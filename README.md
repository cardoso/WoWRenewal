# WoW Renewal Project (3.3.5)


This is a fork of TrinityCore, please check out the [original repository](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/tree/3.3.5) for more information.


## About


### The purpose of this fork is to renew the WoW 3.3.5 gameplay experience by:


- Overhauling existing mechanics
- Reducing waste of time while playing


### And NOT by:


- Making it a different game
- Making it easier than it should


### Specific goals


- Bring old players back
- Friendlier experience to busy people


### Challenges


- Remove excessive walking, but keep exploration
- Reduce waste of time, but keep difficulty
- Tweak mechanics, but keep their essence
- Add new features, but keep the old relevant
- Do all that in a seamless way


## Current Features


### Super Hearthstone


- Hearthstone can now store multiple homes (opens Gossip dialog when used).
- When setting home with an InnKeeper, he adds that home to the Hearthstone.
- When selecting one of your homes, the Hearthstone skill is used and you still get the 30min cooldown
- Needs more limitation (maximum number of homes? money penalty? location based cooldown)


## Planned Features


### Blowing Horn


- Access bank, AH or trainer anywhere, but only when in a city
- Limited by 10min cooldown and tax proportional to level


## Issues

You should open issues to:


- Suggest changes to current features (nothing here is set in stone)
- Suggest new features
- Report unexpected behaviours caused by WoWRenewal


You should not open issues to:


- Fix things that are TrinityCore's problems. (Please do that in the [original repository](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/tree/3.3.5))

### Disclosure


I am a much better developer than i am a WoW player, so my features will most likely break something, add new exploits, etc.
Thus, i need help to prevent these as much as possible.
